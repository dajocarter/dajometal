I knew I wanted to use a static site generator for this website but there's an abundant amount of them out there. I tried the Jekyll + GitHub Pages route once, but in all honesty, I forgot my workflow after leaving it for a few months. If I can't come back to a project after months of being away then the workflow is too tough to keep.
