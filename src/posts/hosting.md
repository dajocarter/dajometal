So you've built a static site, but now you need somewhere to host it. Luckily, hosting options for static sites are cheap and plenty due to their size, simplicity, and security. I had some time to compare a few options and decided to document my choices. The hosting providers I looked at were GitHub Pages, Surge, PubStorm, and Netlify. Let me know if there are any others I should have taken a look at! I ended up choosing Netlify as my hosting provider and this post explains that decision.

## Why Not ________?

Because I said so. No Mom, it's because Netlify *really is* better than the other options. Let's go through the hosting providers and see why I *didn't* pick them. The first provider I looked at was [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). That's because I was already using them with a Jekyll site and it's **FREE**! I didn't go with them because the lack of ability to customize. Sure, I can use a custom domain, but I can't get SSL on it. I also don't like to have separate branches for the build and source directories, but that's more of a personal preference (and probably a lack of git skills). I enjoy being able to push my updates and seeing them deploy instantly, but I found other options that do just that.

In my search for a hosting provider, I was first led to [Surge](https://surge.sh).

The next provider I came across was [Pubstorm](https://pubstorm.com).

Finally, I discovered [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Getting Started with Netlify

Explain how to get started with Netlify. Easy sign up process. Connect your github/gitlab/bitbucket repository. Optionally choose a task that runs the build. Hook up your asset optimization. Push and deploy!

## Using Netlify to Improve Your Development Worflow

Whaaat, how's hosting going to improve my workflow? Netlify makes sure deployment is one less thing to worry about for you. Go over Slack notifications and include a screenshot of their beauty. Talk about how awesome the new live-preview feature is for staging new development features.

## What Else Is There?

Talk about being able to customize the headers of your site. Can add webhooks for all sorts of crazy integration. Is there something you find useful that I'm not using?
