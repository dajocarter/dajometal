One of the reasons I opted to build a static site was the ease of finding a cheap hosting provider. I had been using GitHub pages, but I wanted to check out what some of the other options had to offer. The hosting providers I considered were [Surge](https://surge.sh/), [Pubstorm](https://www.pubstorm.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). An honorable mention should also go out to hosting your own static site on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). I ended up going with Netlify and I wanted to share my reasons.

## Cost

I always gotta have my mind on my money and my money on my mind :moneybag: So the first thing I considered was the cost so let's get a breakdown going.

| Hosting Providers | Cost |
| :--- | :---: |
| GitHub Pages | Free |
| Netlify | $7.50/mo[^first] |
| Pubstorm | Free |
| Surge | $13/mo[^first] |

Since they all provide free options for hosting, I decided to make a branch for each provider

[^first]: Both Netlify and Surge also offer free options, but if you're going to be using it in production, you'll most likely be going with a paid plan.
